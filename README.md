Software Test Automation & QA

How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  
In order for the code to be funtional I need to run the code to see that it is working as intended and if not 
the go back and adjust any errors in the code. If errors are left then the code will not function as needed
and can leave holes to become far less secure.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I make sure the user needs are outlined and made apparent, I then one at a time implement each function into the code
so that each user need is met until every user need is implemented and that the program is operating as intended.

How do I approach designing software?

I approach designing software by making sure that the user needs are met along with simplifing the code 
to make sure it is in working fashion. You don't want uneeded code in the software as it makes it much harder to read
you need to keep things straightforward or else you can run into many issues.
